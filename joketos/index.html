        <h2>8. Morality Clause: Provider's Commitment to Appropriate Humor</h2>
        <p>8.1. <strong>Standard of Conduct</strong>: The Provider agrees to refrain from generating or disseminating jokes that may be reasonably considered as unfaithfully inappropriate or morally objectionable. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Jokes that deliberately demean or target individuals, groups, or institutions on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected characteristics.</li>
            <li>Content that could be construed as promoting, endorsing, or trivializing infidelity, betrayal, or dishonesty in personal, romantic, or professional relationships.</li>
            <li>Jokes that may cause undue harm, distress, or embarrassment to vulnerable individuals or communities, especially in sensitive contexts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>8.2. <strong>Intent of Humor</strong>: Providor acknowledges that humor, while subjective, must be rooted in principles of respect and integrity.

        <p>8.3. <strong>Accountability</strong>: Providor assumes full responsibility for the nature and impact of the jokes produced. In the event that a joke is unintentionally perceived as unfaithfully inappropriate or causes unintended harm, Providor shall review and, if necessary, amend the conduct accordingly, with a commitment to learning and growth from such incidents.</p>
        <p>8.4. <strong>Good Faith Exception</strong>: Jokes created in good faith, with the intention of challenging societal norms or engaging in satire, shall not be considered a breach of this clause, provided they remain within the boundaries of decency and respect.</p>

    <h1>Terms and Conditions of Joke Engagement</h1>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
    <p>For the purposes of this document, which you are likely not reading unless you're legally bored or just nosy, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
    <p><strong>"Jokes"</strong>: Any arrangement of words, gestures, memes, or comedic phenomena intended to elicit laughter, chuckles, snorts, nose-exhales, or catastrophic silence. Includes, but is not limited to, puns, absurdities, ironies, and occasional existential dread masked in humor.</p>
    <p><strong>"Provider"</strong>: The legally unqualified, socially questionable source of aforementioned Jokes—may also be referred to as "me" in less formal contracts or DMs.</p>
    <p><strong>"User"</strong>: The unlucky individual who reads, hears, or is exposed to the Jokes. This includes scrollers, lurkers, followers, enemies, and people who laugh just to be polite.</p>
    <p><strong>"Engagement"</strong>: Any act of attention, response, or passive absorption of the Jokes, whether voluntary, accidental, or under peer pressure.</p>
    <p><strong>"Dark Humor"</strong>: Material designed to poke at life’s darker corners—mortality, societal hypocrisy, or whatever Freud would've side-eyed. May or may not cause laughter followed by guilt, followed by laughter again.</p>
</section>

<section id="darkHumorDisclaimer">
    <h2>2. Dark Humor Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>By proceeding to consume, acknowledge, or mentally replay any Jokes classified or misclassified as "Dark Humor," the User agrees that some content may be considered wildly inappropriate in polite company, most funerals, or HR training. The Provider is not responsible for emotional, psychological, or cosmological crises induced by such content. If you're crying and laughing at the same time, you're welcome.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>3. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>By scrolling, reading, chuckling, or even blinking in proximity to these Jokes, you accept all stated and unstated conditions within this Agreement.</li>
        <li>The Provider offers no guarantee of humor efficacy, cultural appropriateness, or meme relatability beyond the year 2016.</li>
        <li>By laughing—even internally—you waive any rights to whine, cancel, sue, or subtweet in outrage.</li>
        <li>Failure to read these terms does not exempt you from their binding force, because ignorance of satire is no excuse in meme court.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>4. No Warranties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Provider expressly denies all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to: emotional uplift, social acceptance, or any improvement in your dating prospects.</li>
        <li>All Jokes are offered "as-is" and may contain traces of hyperbole, outdated references, and unsolicited nihilism.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Provider assumes no responsibility for injuries incurred while laughing, including face cramps, choking on coffee, or being escorted out of a library.</li>
        <li>Social fallout due to repeating these Jokes in family gatherings or job interviews is your cross to bear.</li>
        <li>Provider cannot be held liable for any existential spirals triggered mid-scroll. Meditate or hydrate as needed.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>6. Assumption of Risk</h2>
    <p>By proceeding, the User assumes all risks associated with exposing themselves to humor that may challenge deeply held beliefs, social norms, and the illusion that we're all taking this life thing seriously. Side effects may include introspection, confusion, and the urge to laugh at things you absolutely shouldn’t. No refunds.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>7. User Conduct</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>User shall not dissect the Jokes in a manner that renders them clinically unfunny. This includes Reddit threads and philosophy majors.</li>
        <li>Complaints about taste, tone, or timing must be sent to the void and will be acknowledged by the nearest raccoon.</li>
        <li>Users agree that bad jokes are part of the ecosystem and shall be treated like rain: inconvenient but unavoidable.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>8. Morality Clause</h2>
    <p>Provider commits to deploying humor with some vague degree of moral compass. While lines may be tiptoed, hopped over, or occasionally cartwheeled across, content is not intended to target vulnerable communities, spread hate, or summon ancient gods.</p>
    <p>Should any Joke be perceived as irreparably offensive, the Provider will perform a ritual of self-reflection (approx. 0.6 seconds), then carry on with life—possibly wiser, possibly not.</p>
